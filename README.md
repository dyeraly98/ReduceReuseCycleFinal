# ReduceReuseCycleFinal
A non profit organization that is pushing for an increase in bicycling around the Rochester area.

# Purpose of the site
The purpose of the site for our bike shop entitled “Reduce. Reuse. Cycle.” is to inform citizens of Rochester, New York about the benefits of bike lanes and commuting to their destinations by bicycle and motivate them to get involved in our campaign. We want those who visit the site to easily find information about why we want to help the environment as well as the several events we put on to support our cause. They can also find how to contact us as well as how to donate or buy a bike from us for use in their daily lives.
 
 
# Usability Testing
During the usability testing, we asked four people a series of five questions and for constructive criticism. We had the design for all six pages of our site together on Auxure and allowed them to flip through each one as many times as they wanted. We asked them;
1.   Where would they find information about upcoming activities
2.   Where they could find our contact information
3.   The ease of navigating between tabs
4.   Where do they look first when on the homepage
5.   Which tab they would be inclined to click on first.

The first two participants said they would find upcoming activities under the events tab which was correct, but the last two said they would go to the Get Involved tab to find upcoming events. With the next two questions, the first and third participants gave the correct answer on where to find contact information which was at the bottom of each page. The other two said that they would go to About Us first to find contact information, but then they quickly realized the information was on every page. Each participant found ease in navigating between tabs, despite some of their troubles with the Mac mouse. They all also said their eye goes directly to the large image we have in the middle of the Home page.

For the final question, each participant put themselves into the mindset of a passionate biker or environmentalist. The first person said that they would visit About Us after arriving to the site to gain background information on what our purpose and mission statement is. The second participant was interested in what we had to offer under the Shop tab and wanted to see what kind of bike they could buy. The last two participants both wanted to click on the Get Involved tab because they would want to find some biking activities to do around the area.

Instead of setting a color scheme for the website, we asked the participants what colors they would want or expect to see for the purpose of our business. Two participants said they would assume the site would use green, while the other two said they would expect to see red. As they gave us constructive criticism, they suggested reducing the amount of text we have and increase the font size because they admitted they would not read it all. But they all agreed that the layout was efficient and the use of images flowed well.
